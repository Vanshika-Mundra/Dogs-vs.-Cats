# Dogs-vs.-Cats
an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats

-The Asirra data set
-to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Computer will find it a bit more difficult.
-Such a challenge is often called a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) or HIP (Human Interactive Proof). HIPs are used for many purposes, such as to reduce email and blog spam and prevent brute-force attacks on web site passwords.
-Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a HIP that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately.
-Asirra is unique because of its partnership with Petfinder.com, the world's largest site devoted to finding homes for homeless pets. They've provided Microsoft Research with over three million images of cats and dogs, manually classified by people at thousands of animal shelters across the United States. 
-Image recognition attacks
While random guessing is the easiest form of attack, various forms of image recognition can allow an attacker to make guesses that are better than random. There is enormous diversity in the photo database (a wide variety of backgrounds, angles, poses, lighting, etc.), making accurate automatic classification difficult. In an informal poll conducted many years ago, computer vision experts posited that a classifier with better than 60% accuracy would be difficult without a major advance in the state of the art. For reference, a 60% classifier improves the guessing probability of a 12-image HIP from 1/4096 to 1/459.
-State of the art
The current literature suggests machine classifiers can score above 80% accuracy on this task [1]. Therfore, Asirra is no longer considered safe from attack.  We have created this contest to benchmark the latest computer vision and deep learning approaches to this problem. Can you crack the CAPTCHA? Can you improve the state of the art? Can you create lasting peace between cats and dogs?

Okay, we'll settle for the former. 


--goal is trace in camera if a cat and dog are found homeless anywhere in the locality and provide them safe and better habitat.And to train computer to do so.And achieve maximum efficiency.To overcome the challenges faced by computer due to diversified database.
